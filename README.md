# Self-learning Snake Game
Deep Q Learning Artificial Intelligence on a Snake Game by Reinforcement

## Description:
This is an Artificial Intelligence developed in Python using Torch and Anaconda.
<br> It uses the well known Snake game as an environment to Train.
<br> The Deep Q Learning is supervised by a medium size Agent with neural network, and is trained on a written Model.
<br> We are rendering some scoring data using matplotlib graphs, and a high speed live game displayer. Of course, the speed can be changed.

## Instructions:
- Run the game.py environment through Anaconda
- Launch the agent.py
- Let the Snake learn by itself using our model.py

## Additional Information:
- This Artificial Intelligence has been made with the help of "Python Engineer" (Youtube) and uses a pre-released Snake game as the environment
